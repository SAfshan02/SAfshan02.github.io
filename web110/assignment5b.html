        Session 5b Internet Fundamentals/Communications
        Activity: "Intellectual Property and Peer-to-Peer File Sharing"
        Delving into the review of RIAA's stance on piracy and researching legal issues related to 
        illegal peer-to-peer file sharing provided crucial insights into intellectual property 
        protection. In my current work environment, where content creation and distribution are 
        integral, understanding the legal ramifications of file sharing is paramount. Applying this 
        knowledge ensures compliance with copyright laws and protects intellectual property. In the 
        future, as digital content creation and distribution become increasingly prevalent, navigating 
        intellectual property issues will be a continual responsibility. This understanding positions 
        me to contribute to ethical content practices, safeguarding creative assets and respecting legal 
        boundaries in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.
