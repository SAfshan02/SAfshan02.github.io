        Activity 1: "HTML Validation"
        In completing the HTML Validation activity, I utilized the W3C Markup Validation Service to 
        check the HTML code of one of my web pages. This tool helped me ensure that my HTML code 
        follows the correct syntax and structure according to the W3C standards. By analyzing the 
        validation results, I learned about any errors or warnings in my code and made the necessary 
        corrections to ensure compliance. This activity reinforced the importance of writing clean 
        and valid HTML code for better accessibility and compatibility across different browsers and 
        devices. In my current and future web development projects, I plan to regularly use this 
        validation service to maintain the quality and accessibility of my HTML code.
        
        Activity 2: "Color Contrast Check"
        For the Color Contrast Check activity, I employed the WebAIM Contrast Checker to evaluate the 
        color contrast of text and background colors on one of my web pages. This tool helped me ensure 
        that the text is easily readable for users with visual impairments or those viewing the website 
        in different lighting conditions. By adjusting the color combinations to meet the recommended 
        contrast ratios, I improved the accessibility of my website and ensured that all users can 
        comfortably read the content. In my future projects, I will continue to prioritize color contrast 
        to enhance the overall accessibility and usability of my websites for all users.
