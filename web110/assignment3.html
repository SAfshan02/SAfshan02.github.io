        Session 3 Internet Fundamentals/Search Engines
        Activity 1: "Compare Search Engines"
        The tutorials on "Search Engines" on TutorialsPoint and "Search Better" on GCFLearnFree 
        are both finished. Google, Bing, Yahoo, Ask, and other well-known search engines' various 
        features and functionalities were covered in the tutorials. Understanding market share, 
        assessing user interfaces, and comparing search results were all covered in the tutorials.
        All search engines have advantages and disadvantages, and I've learned about the subject. 
        For example, Bing prioritizes visual search and integration with Microsoft products, 
        whereas Google is well-known for its robust algorithms and vast index. Unique features are 
        also present in Yahoo and Ask. Google leads the search engine industry, but I also learned 
        that market share varies.
        I see myself using this knowledge to select the best search engine for my present or future 
        environment for particular jobs. 
        For instance, I might use Google if I need thorough and pertinent information. 
        Bing, meanwhile, might be more suited for queries that focus on images. Making strategic 
        decisions about online presence or digital marketing can also benefit from an understanding 
        of market share.

        Activity 2: "Learn about Search Engine Optimization (SEO)"
        I delved into the "Get your content on Google" tutorial provided by Google to understand 
        the basics of Search Engine Optimization (SEO). The tutorial outlined the importance of 
        making web content easily discoverable by search engines and how to submit a page for 
        indexing.
        I updated the Google search engine with the Wikiversity page URL associated with this 
        activity as a way to put the knowledge I had learned into practice. The procedure comprised 
        utilizing Google's Search Console to submit the page URL.
        I discovered that search engine optimization (SEO) is essential to making sure that web 
        material is efficiently indexed and presented in search engine results. Webmasters can 
        improve the exposure of their material and increase its accessibility to users searching 
        for relevant information by submitting a page to Google.
        I can relate this idea to my present and future surroundings and see how important SEO is 
        to online visibility and digital marketing. Whether running a blog, website, or other 
        online platform, following SEO best practices can increase traffic and enhance user 
        experience in general. Furthermore useful applications of this knowledge include reaching 
        a target audience, improving a project's or business's internet profile, and optimizing 
        material for particular keywords.
