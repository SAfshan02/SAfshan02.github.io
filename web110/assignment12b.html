        Session 12b Internet Fundamentals/IT Careers
        
        Activity 1: "Career Planning"
        In completing the Career Planning tutorial from GCFLearnFree activity, allows individuals to 
        understand the importance of strategic career planning and salary considerations. This lesson 
        taught me how to assess my values, interests, and abilities in order to determine how well they 
        match various IT job routes. I also learned more about professional development techniques and 
        how to create realistic career objectives. Applying these concepts to my current or future 
        environment involves leveraging this self-awareness to make informed career decisions, such as 
        pursuing relevant certifications or acquiring additional skills to advance in the IT industry. 
        Additionally, I can utilize the salary information provided to negotiate better compensation 
        packages and plan for long-term career growth.
