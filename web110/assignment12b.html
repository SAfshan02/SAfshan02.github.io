        Session 12b Internet Fundamentals/IT Careers
        
        Activity 1: "Career Planning"
        In completing the Career Planning tutorial from GCFLearnFree activity, allows individuals to 
        understand the importance of strategic career planning and salary considerations. Through this 
        tutorial, I learned about evaluating personal interests, skills, and values to align with 
        potential career paths in IT. I also gained insights into setting achievable career goals and 
        strategies for professional development. Applying these concepts to my current or future 
        environment involves leveraging this self-awareness to make informed career decisions, such as 
        pursuing relevant certifications or acquiring additional skills to advance in the IT industry. 
        Additionally, I can utilize the salary information provided to negotiate better compensation 
        packages and plan for long-term career growth.
