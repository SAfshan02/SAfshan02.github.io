        Session 8 Internet Fundamentals/HTML
        
        Throughout the HTML activities, I acquired a comprehensive understanding of web page 
        structuring, incorporating elements such as anchor links and unordered lists. Hands-on 
        experience with HTML validation tools enriched my skills, emphasizing the importance of 
        adherence to industry standards. This newfound proficiency is immediately applicable in my 
        current professional environment, enhancing my capacity to contribute effectively to web 
        development initiatives. The ability to create and manage anchor links proves valuable for 
        optimizing website navigation. As I envision my future in the field, these acquired skills 
        position me to craft user-friendly interfaces, uphold coding best practices, and actively 
        engage in the dynamic realm of evolving web development.
