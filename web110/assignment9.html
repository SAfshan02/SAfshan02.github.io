    <h1>Assignment 9 - Internal and Inline Styles</h1>
    <p>
        <p style="color: blue; margin-left: 30px;">During this lesson, I gained valuable insights 
            into the power of CSS in web development.</p>
        
        <p style="color: red; background-color: yellow;">I ensured a seamless integration of 
            internal and inline styles. Reflecting on this process, I've deepened my 
            understanding of CSS properties, such as color, background, alignment, and fonts. 
            This hands-on experience not only refined my web development skills but also sparked 
            insights into the dynamic interplay between HTML and CSS.</p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 24px;">Through this, I've gained valuable knowledge applicable to 
            my current and future web projects. My journey in this assignment served as a 
            practical exploration of design principles, paving the way for me to elevate the 
            aesthetics and functionality of my digital creations.</p>
