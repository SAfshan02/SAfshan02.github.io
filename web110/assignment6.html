        Session 6 Internet Fundamentals/Networking
        Activity 1: "Completing Internet Tutorials"
        For the first activity, I completed tutorials on Internet Reference Models, Internet Protocols, 
        and the Internet Domain Name System (DNS) provided by TutorialsPoint. These tutorials enhanced my 
        understanding of the foundational concepts that govern the functioning of the Internet. The 
        Internet Reference Models tutorial elucidated the structural frameworks guiding network 
        communication, while the Internet Protocols tutorial delved into the specific protocols 
        governing data exchange. Understanding the DNS became crucial in comprehending how domain names 
        are translated into IP addresses, facilitating seamless web navigation.
        Through these tutorials, I gained a more profound insight into the intricacies of the 
        Internet's architecture, protocols, and naming systems. This knowledge equips me with a 
        solid foundation to comprehend and navigate the digital landscape effectively.
        

        Activity 2: "Reviewing IP Address Settings"
        For the second activity, I conducted a comprehensive review of IP address settings for my 
        local network across different operating systems. In the Windows environment, I referred to 
        Microsoft resources on fixing network adapter problems and changing TCP/IP settings. The 
        utilization of ipconfig allowed me to display detailed IP address information and execute 
        actions like releasing and renewing dynamic IP addresses.
        In macOS, I used Network Utility and System Preferences to inspect and renew network settings, 
        ensuring a clear understanding of the configurations governing my network connectivity. 
        Similarly, in Linux, I referred to YoLinux and CyberCiti resources to navigate through network 
        GUI tools and force DHCP client renewal using dhclient. This activity enriched my practical 
        knowledge of managing and troubleshooting network configurations across diverse operating 
        systems. The hands-on experience with IP address settings will be invaluable in maintaining 
        a robust and well-configured network environment in both personal and professional contexts.
