      Summary
        Through the Wikiversity Lesson 1 Northwind Activities, I learned about database querying and data 
        retrieval. Despite the absence of relevant data in the Northwind database for some questions, the 
        exercise provided valuable insight into structuring queries and understanding database 
        relationships. This learning can be applied to my current and future environments by improving 
        my skills in data analysis, which is essential for decision-making and optimizing business processes. 
        Understanding how to effectively retrieve and interpret data from databases will enhance my 
        ability to extract meaningful insights and drive informed decision-making in various professional 
        settings.
