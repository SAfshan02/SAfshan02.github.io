        Session 5a Internet Fundamentals/Social Media
        Activity 1: "TutorialsPoint - Social Networking"
        Engaging in TutorialsPoint's Social Networking tutorial was a deep dive into the diverse 
        functionalities of various social media platforms. Exploring platforms like Facebook, 
        Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Snapchat, I uncovered the nuanced features that define 
        identity expression, conversations, sharing dynamics, and relationship-building within each 
        digital space. The realization that each platform serves as a unique canvas for self-expression 
        and interaction was profound. This newfound comprehension extends beyond personal usage, 
        forming the foundation for a strategic approach to digital communication, networking, and 
        identity establishment in both personal and professional spheres.

        Activity 2: "Smart Insights - The Honeycomb Model Evaluation"
        The second activity involved a meticulous evaluation of popular social media platforms through 
        Smart Insights' Honeycomb model. This framework assesses elements like identity, conversations, 
        sharing, presence, relationships, reputation, and groups. Platforms like Facebook showcased 
        versatility across the Honeycomb model, excelling in identity representation, conversations, 
        sharing, and relationship-building. Conversely, platforms like Snapchat, while proficient in 
        ephemerality, showed limitations in supporting persistent relationships and reputation building. 
        This critical evaluation provides a discerning lens to understand the strategic strengths of each 
        platform, valuable not only for personal engagement but also for a nuanced, platform-specific 
        approach in professional digital marketing and social media management. Armed with this 
        understanding, I am well-equipped to navigate the complex landscape of social media, 
        strategically leveraging each platform's strengths to meet diverse communication and engagement 
        objectives.
