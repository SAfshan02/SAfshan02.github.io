        Session 3 Internet Fundamentals/Search Engines
        Activity 1: "Compare Search Engines"
        The tutorials on "Search Engines" on TutorialsPoint and "Search Better" on GCFLearnFree 
        are both finished. Google, Bing, Yahoo, Ask, and other well-known search engines' various 
        features and functionalities were covered in the tutorials. Understanding market share, 
        assessing user interfaces, and comparing search results were all covered in the tutorials.
        All search engines have advantages and disadvantages, and I've learned about the subject. 
        For example, Bing prioritizes visual search and integration with Microsoft products, 
        whereas Google is well-known for its robust algorithms and vast index. Unique features are 
        also present in Yahoo and Ask. Google leads the search engine industry, but I also learned 
        that market share varies.
        I see myself using this knowledge to select the best search engine for my present or future 
        environment for particular jobs. 
        For instance, I might use Google if I need thorough and pertinent information. 
        Bing, meanwhile, might be more suited for queries that focus on images. Making strategic 
        decisions about online presence or digital marketing can also benefit from an understanding 
        of market share.
