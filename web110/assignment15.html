        Final Project idea:

        Here is the plan Gantt chart of my final project <img src="images/chart.jpg"> and image
        <img src="images/image.png">

        For my final project, I plan to create a comprehensive video tutorial focusing on 
        Internet Fundamentals, with a specific emphasis on web browsers. The video will cover 
        everything from basic browser functionality to advanced customization options and security 
        features. To improve browsing and solve typical problems, I'll offer helpful hints and 
        techniques. Regardless of their level of expertise, the project aims to give viewers the 
        information and abilities they need to maximize their online surfing.

        Session 15 Internet Fundamentals/Project Management

        Through the project management activities in Session 15, I gained insights into the 
        importance of thorough planning, effective execution, and diligent monitoring in managing 
        IT projects. Utilizing project management software enhanced my understanding of organizing 
        tasks, allocating resources, and tracking progress. These learnings will enable me to 
        ensure efficient project management and successful outcomes in my current or future 
        professional roles.
