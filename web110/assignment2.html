        Session 2A Internet Fundamentals/Introduction
         Activity 1: "GCFLearnFree - Internet Basics" 
         In this activity, I explored the foundational concepts of the Internet 
         through GCFLearnFree's Internet Basics activity. The course covered topics ranging from the 
         history of the internet to essential web browser functions. I gained a deeper understanding of 
         internet protocols and the role of URLs.I learned about the evolution of the Internet and 
         its impact on modern communication. Understanding the fundamentals, such as how browsers 
         interact with servers and the purpose of various online tools, has provided me with a 
         solid foundation for efficient internet use. These concepts are immediately applicable to 
         my daily online activities. For instance, knowing how browsers handle data helps me make 
         informed decisions about privacy settings. 
         Additionally, comprehending the basics of URLs empowers me to navigate websites more 
         efficiently. In the future, this knowledge will be invaluable as I explore advanced 
         internet technologies or pursue web-related projects.
         Activity 1: "Understanding File Extensions"
         The activity covered a range of common file extensions and their associated applications, 
         providing insights into the importance of choosing appropriate file formats. This tutorial equipped 
         me with a comprehensive understanding of file extensions and the three or four-letter codes 
         attached to the end of a filename. I learned that these extensions indicate the format of 
         a file and determine which program or software can open, edit, or interpret it. 
         The tutorial clarified the distinctions between various file types, such as documents, 
         images, and multimedia files, based on their extensions. Armed with this knowledge, I can 
         make more informed decisions when saving, sharing, or opening files. 
         Choosing the right file format ensures compatibility and prevents issues with accessing or 
         editing documents. Additionally, understanding file extensions enhances my ability to 
         organize digital files effectively, leading to a more efficient and structured approach to 
         managing information in the future.
        
        Session 2A Internet Fundamentals/Web Browsers
         Activity 1: "Complete Tutorials on Web Browsers" 
         This activity involves completing tutorials on web browsers from platforms 
         like TutorialsPoint and GCFLearnFree. By completing these tutorials, I gain a comprehensive 
         understanding of the functions of web browsers, user customization features, and various 
         aspects of internet browsing, such as accessing websites, ensuring security, and undertaking 
         online transactions. The knowledge gained from these tutorials can be applied to your daily 
         internet usage. For example, you can configure and customize your preferred web browser settings, 
         ensure a secure browsing experience, and efficiently navigate and utilize online resources.

         functionality and security of different web browsers. Through this activity, I learn how to 
         customize the settings of popular web browsers like Brave, Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, 
         and Safari. Additionally, you explore the installation and management of browser extensions.
         The knowledge gained from this activity empowers you to tailor your browsing experience 
         according to your preferences and needs. You can improve security, streamline navigation, 
         and boost productivity by adjusting browser settings and incorporating useful extensions. 
         For example, you can explore password managers, ad blockers, and other extensions to optimize 
         your online activities. In the future, change settings and try new tools based on your 
         evolving online habits.
