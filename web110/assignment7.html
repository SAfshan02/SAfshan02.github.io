        Session 7 Internet Fundamentals/Security
        Activity 1: "Completing Internet Safety and Security Tutorials"
        In the process of completing the GCFLearnFree and TutorialsPoint tutorials on Internet Safety 
        and Security, I gained valuable insights into safeguarding my online activities. Completing this 
        session broadened my understanding of online threats and protective measures. Learning about 
        secure browsing habits, adjusting privacy settings, and recognizing potential risks provided 
        essential knowledge. Applying these insights involves implementing consistent safe browsing 
        practices, regularly reviewing and updating privacy settings across platforms, and fostering a 
        culture of online security through education. These principles not only enhance my current online 
        safety but also shape a proactive approach for future digital interactions, emphasizing the 
        importance of continual vigilance in the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity.
        

        Activity 2: "Testing Firewall with ShieldsUP! by Gibson Research"
        Engaging in the firewall test through ShieldsUP! by Gibson Research was an enlightening 
        experience in understanding the vulnerabilities and strengths of my network security. By 
        evaluating the effectiveness of my firewall against common online threats, I gained valuable 
        insights into potential areas for improvement. Applying this learning to my current and future 
        environment involves routinely conducting firewall tests to ensure ongoing protection. 
        Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of staying informed about emerging threats and 
        adjusting firewall configurations accordingly. Implementing regular firewall assessments 
        contributes to a proactive approach to maintaining a robust defense against cyber threats in 
        both personal and professional settings.
